3/27 Tree traversals

- main traversal method is recursion, loops are possible as well.
- if you need to process all nodes in a tree, tree traversal.
-3 ways for a binary tree
    - pre-order
        process the root, print
        left subtree, then process the right subtree. Using recursion
    - in-order
        process the nodes in the left subtree recursively
        process the root 
        process the nodes in the right subtree recursively
    - post-order
        root is last

Binary Search Tree
    they are organized and structured
        the values in n's left subtree are less than or equal to n
        the values in n's right subtree are greater than or equal to n

    3 things to consider when deleting from a bst 
        N is a leaf
            easy. set the pointer from parent to null, release memory
        N has only 1 child
            2 cases, left child and right child. set the child parent node to Ns parent node
        N has 2 children
            must choose 1
